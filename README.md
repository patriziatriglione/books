#### Description
This site is a kind of "google" for books where you can search for the title, author or genre of a book. 
Also, there are buttons where you can view a list of books based on the selected genre. 
Each book shows the title, the author. cover and its description.
If you enter an unknown title or author, a warning will be shown.

There is also a small carousel in which a sentence relating to the world of reading appears every few seconds.

Javascript and some of its libraries were used for this project, including <b>Axios, Lodash</b> and <b>Sweetalert2</b>.
For the graphic part, however, the <b>"Tailwind Css"</b> framework was used.

#### Istructions
The site looks like this:

- At the top we find his name and the carousel with phrases inspired by the world of reading.
After it we find the search bar where it is possible to write genre, author name or title of a book and, by pressing enter or clicking "search", the search begins.
